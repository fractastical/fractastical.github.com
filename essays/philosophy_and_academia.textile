There is always a problem in ascribing value to any work which does not exist in a particularly obvious quantitatively observable modus. In the case of writings, we can provide a structure and certain set of rules but, beyond this, our assessments very easily become "arbitrary," in the sense that we can not give an obviously clear justification for them.

The obvious alternative is to use tests to assess intelligence, as well as grades, which are usually the ability of a student to conform to the expectations of their teachers (a very useful skill to have, if not necessarily indicative of "thinking" in any greater or abstract way). 

However, virtually all other ways forward ultimately become very quickly attempts to capture aspects of our "intuition" concerning the holy triumvarite of truth-beauty-good. 

This is usually accessible because of the presence of universals, or at least universals with the context of a particular civilization. The light one (and contrast) that one finds in Caravaggio is amazingly and shockingly beautiful and even when one lines up near-contemporaries who attempted the same thing, the magnificance of the former is merely underlined.
