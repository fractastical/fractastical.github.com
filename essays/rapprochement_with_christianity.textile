I have deliberately approached and re-involved myself with Christ-proclaiming communities regardless of the specific dogma and advocacy included within the community. I have even gone so far as to attempt to contribute to the community without a specific awareness or examination of the dogma or organizational structure. I suspect that in both cases I would not find the situation ideal and it is quite possible that I would object to many of the enshrined teachings by supposed masters in the tradition if forced to examine them in this light.
