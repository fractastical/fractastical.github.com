My approach to the poem has gone something like this. "Traditionalist" decay of metre via T.S. Eliot with some accompaniment by "gospel" mode -> Zenification under the help of Basho, Li Bai, Du Fu, etc. (after learning these languages), leading to a more precise and shorter "gem" -> Romanticisation/Universalization under the influence of Goethe / Novalis -> More extensive appropriation of folk songs and grail mythos, particularly of the high middle ages. I've never recovered the desire to write much and retain a preference for short, laser-like pieces. At the moment I am exclusively in the world of Dante and Gabrielle D'Annunzio.

Of course, Shakespear is the greatest.
