I've always considered the Italians the acme of the visual mode: Raphael, Giotto, Fra Angelico, Fra Lippi, Cimabue, Titian, Caravaggio. The greatest are so in their ability to deal with light, and in the contrast that light has with darkness: Raphael, Caravaggio, Rembrandt. I am somewhat sympathetic to digital art, although I don't think anything has emerged that challenges the great masters. Beyond that, I am sympathetic to the pre-Raphaelites, esp. J.W. Waterhouse, D.G. Rossetti. I also am fond of Bouguereau. Nothing past Klimt moves me.
