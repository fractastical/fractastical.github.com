Edu Lightning

LOGO : “EDU” plus lightning bolt

Plan :

	Social network organized around attainment
	A number of courses (mostly from other places) :

		- Each course has videos (links, e.g. khan academy)
		- Each course involves a bunch of financial committed people (allow for financial hardship)
		- Allow people to design their own courses  (credentials)
		- Each course transpires over a number of weeks (maybe 8? with some schedule)
		- Require a certain minimum number of people
		- Each course allows students to see how other students are progressing (watching videos, completing assignments) 
- Each course also has assignments that must be submitted 		- Allow for teachers / coaches to grade and or certify
		- Each course has typical text based interactions (fora, live chat)
		- Each course also allows for periodic meetups
		- Unique “Grading” system
				- assignments completed on time
				- quality of assignments
				- lectures watched 
				- participation (maintain 2 posts per week on boards, include something about length) 
				- extra credit 
		- Some sort of certification is issued at the end (for lightening approved members)
		- You get your money back (based on “grade”)
		- Can pay for printed copy of certificate

Examples:

	- Khan academy
	
General considerations:

	“Cute” but minimalistic theming. Appeal to a broad audience
	Don’t use money as primary motivator – hid financial calculations until the end.
	Facilitate collective energy / positive group dynamics
	Encourage enthusiasts
	Make platform as flexible as possible
	Where finances are involved, take cut rather than flat fees
	Don’t rely on or solicit existing brick and mortar institutions (they are useless)
	Ensure quality content (difficult!)	

Due Diligence:

Other online universities – what are they doing well? What not so well?

Khan

	- otherwise awesome
